# Linear Kalman filter
The Linear Kalman filter algorithm consists of five phases and is
used for linear system problems. 

Linear Kalman filter consists of five phases:
1) Absolute measurement of motionless robot (AMOML);
2) Absolute measurement of moving robot (AMOM);
3) Relative measurement of motionless robot (RMOML);
4) Relative measurement of moving robot (RMOM);
5) Relative measurement of moving robot/while the position
of robot is not detected
